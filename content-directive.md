## @content Directive

In this guide we're going to talk about the content directive now the content directive is a very helpful little tool that we can use with mixins that allow us to make a little bit more flexible kinds of interfaces for those mixins. 


can be more intuitive than manual setting all values and calling them.. that works. 
- get rid of arguments and mixin code
- instead of taking in a notification, pass in @content
- this allows us to place any other styles we want 
- the content directive yeilds to whatever is passed in 
- the way you call or pass data in curly braces
- not limited by items. you can add more or override in each content directive 

there are plenty of times to use arugments in mixins but content directives are good for a little more flexibilty. 
dont have to worry about default types or passing in values
