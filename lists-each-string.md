## Scss Lists
- lists

## @each directive
- looks a lot like a mixins or metaprogramming
- pass in an iterater variable
- dynamically creating code on the fly
  - in this case, it creates car classes dynamically
- code that writes code


## string interpolation 
- use same syntax as ruby 
- ```#{}```
- helps remove duplication

This is something that's pretty cool. One of the top goals that Scss looks to accomplish is to help you as a developer be as efficient as possible with your code to **remove duplication** and to be able to organize your code in a way that it's **intuitive** and **scalable**. And that's what these three components do.
